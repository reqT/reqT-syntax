//To patch the generated ReqTTokenMaker.java, do the following

//search for:

zzCurrentPos = zzMarkedPos = zzPushbackPos = s.offset;

//and replace with:

zzCurrentPos = zzMarkedPos = s.offset;

//search for and delete these two methods:

private boolean zzRefill() throws java.io.IOException {  
  // the long zzRefill() method with around 50 lines of code should be deleted
  // the short zzRefill() method with only one line should NOT be deleted 
}
  
public final void yyreset(java.io.Reader reader) {
  // the yyreset(java.io.Reader reader) that is not declared to throw should be deleted
  // the yyreset(java.io.Reader reader) that throws IOException should NOT be deleted
}
  
// delete from the /** opening comment until end of method just before next /**
